# Cutiepybot
Cutiepybot is an IRC bot built using Python. It works as a quote generator and has Motivational, Literary and Philosophical quotes.

# Run
There are 4 files, three modules which contain the quotes and the main file. All of these should be downloaded and the channel and server name of the IRC should be changed before running it. 

```python 
socket.getaddrinfo("182.73.209.206",6665) #IP address of the server
server = "chat.freenode.net" # Server
channel = "##testabotforme" # Channel
```
